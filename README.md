# Sports Bet Tracking Application

<br>

- **What will the application do?**
<br> My proposal for my personal project is an application for the user to track down their sports bets 
(specifically NBA and NHL).
The user will be able to manually enter in details of every bet. This includes the date, event, amount
staked, odds, and outcome (did you win or lose the bet). After entering this information for each bet, the application
will keep track of all the data and output statistics including overall money won/loss, win percentage, and total 
number of wins and losses. This application allows the user to view every single bet they've ever placed and their 
personalized statistics.

  <br>
- **Who will use it?** <br>
The targeted audience for this application are people who would like to responsibly bet or become a responsible better. 

  <br>
- **Why is this project of interest to you?** <br>
This is a topic of interest to me since I personally sport bet but also believe sports betting can be very harmful to
people. Especially since it's a fast-growing industry with an increasing amount of advertisements and influencers 
promoting it, I think it's becoming a problem in many people's lives. My hope is that if people
start tracking their bets on an application like this, some may realize how much money they're really losing and 
decide to seek help in order to quit.
